          <td>MSE</td>
          <td>MSE is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss. The fact that MSE is almost always strictly positive (and not zero) is because of randomness or because the estimator does not account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate. The MSE is a measure of the quality of an estimator — it is always non-negative, and values closer to zero are better. </td>
